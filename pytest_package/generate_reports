We can generate html reports in Selenium
First we should install html plugin
To install
    Go to cmd prompt --> pip install pytest-html


To generate the reports
    Right click --> open in --> terminal --> pytest test_filename.py -vs --html="report_name.html"
    The above command will store the html report in the same package as the pytest file

To store the reports in other location
    Right click --> open in --> terminal --> pytest test_filename.py -vs --html="location\report_name.html"
